## Overview

Music streaming has become an integral part of our lives in today’s digital age. Whether we're commuting, working out, or simply relaxing at home, music is a constant companion. With the growing number of music streaming platforms, it's essential to have a solution that seamlessly transfers your playlists and libraries between services. That’s where SoundWise comes in.

SoundWise allows users to effortlessly transfer playlists between popular music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. With just a few clicks, users can move their favorite music collections from one service to another, eliminating the hassle of manually recreating playlists.

### Problem Space

SoundWise is designed for music lovers who want to switch between Spotify and Apple Music without losing their playlists. This includes users exploring both platforms who need to maintain consistency across them, as well as people transitioning from free to premium plans on a new service and wishing to keep their music preferences intact.
